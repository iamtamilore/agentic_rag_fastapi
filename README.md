# agentic_rag_fastapi
A FastAPI application that uses an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to securely analyze private patient medical data. This project prioritizes security by running a local LLM via Ollama and demonstrates proficiency in containerization with Docker and Docker Compose, and efficient data retrieval with a PostgreSQL vector database.
